            <h1>Welcome to the International Hybrid Learning Society</h1>
            <p>The International Hybrid Learning Society has the vision of developing a methodology for both teaching and learning by using a combination of traditional face-to-face classroom learning and eLearning. As technologies evolve, it is feasible for students to learn anywhere, at any time, and in any way. In particular, for underdeveloped countries, long distance learning is economical for mass education. eLearning and Hybrid Learning can extend education to many more children than before. The International Hybrid Learning Society is an academic society, and will focus on academic issues only.</p>
