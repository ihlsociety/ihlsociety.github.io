            <p class="mb-0">Education 5.0 marks a shift toward human-centered learning, but integrating artificial intelligence (AI) presents a dual challenge. Although AI provides unmatched personalization, its unguided deployment risks perpetuating inequity and dehumanizing education. This keynote outlines a strategic framework to embed AI within sound pedagogical and ethical principles. It is organized around three core pillars. The first pillar, Participatory, Values-Driven Design, advocates for co-creating AI tools with all stakeholders to ensure relevance and fairness. The second, Transparent Governance and Ethical Safeguards, emphasizes explainable AI, bias auditing, and privacy protocols to build trust and accountability. The third, Immersive Analytics and Adaptive Pathways, leverages data to create personalized learning experiences and empower educators with actionable insights. Combining these pillars provides practical principles for educators and policymakers to foster human-centered learning ecosystems that are resilient, innovative, and supportive of sustained intellectual growth.</p>

            <h5 style="color: var(--primary-color); border-bottom: 2px solid var(--primary-light);">Empowering Non-Technical Teachers as Designers of Virtual Experiential Learning: Insights from the EduVenture-VR Journey</h5>
            <p class="mb-0">Virtual reality (VR) is opening new possibilities for experiential learning by allowing students to explore authentic environments that are often inaccessible due to constraints of time, cost, safety, or distance. EduVenture-VR is a learning system that empowers non-technical teachers to become VR-supported instructional designers who can create and facilitate virtual experiential learning (VEL) for their students. In recent years, the system has been iteratively developed, evolving from the use of teacher-recorded spherical video-based VR (SVVR) to the integration of generative AI, and has been scaled to support immersive and interactive virtual expeditions across diverse subject areas and educational levels in Hong Kong and beyond. This keynote will focus on discussing the empowerment of non-technical teachers as VEL designers, emphasizing that educators are not merely passive users of technology but active creators of meaningful VR-supported learning journeys. Insights into how this pedagogical paradigm fosters students’ learning performance and motivation, drawn from a series of empirical studies, will be shared. It will conclude with reflections on lessons learned from the EduVenture-VR journey and on the opportunities and challenges of scaling teacher-led VEL in the age of AI.</p>

            <p class="mb-0">Software testing is essential for ensuring system reliability. However, some systems face the Oracle Problem, where the correctness of outputs cannot easily be determined. In cybersecurity, password-based authentication is widely used, and tools such as John the Ripper (JtR) can expose vulnerabilities. This paper applies Metamorphic Testing (MT) and Metamorphic Exploration (ME) to JtR, identifying flaws and enhancing system understanding. A web-based Open Educational Resource (OER) was also developed with interactive features to promote the use of MT and support learner engagement. The OER includes quizzes for self-assessment and a feedback mechanism explaining incorrect answers. An initial attempt was made to use Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate on-demand quiz questions and feedback. However, survey participants noted that AI-generated questions were too simple and often contained context clues. This paper will be of interest to educators and researchers in software testing, cybersecurity, and AI-assisted education.</p>

            <p class="mb-0">This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of embodied intelligence in educational contexts, examining its current state and future trajectories. Through a methodological approach combining content analysis of academic literature and case studies of implemented systems, the research reveals how embodied intelligence is transforming educational practices and outcomes. The findings indicate that embodied intelligence technologies integrating physical robots and AI-driven platforms-are enhancing personalized learning, facilitating multimodal interactions, and supporting both cognitive and non-cognitive student development. Critically, the study identifies key trends such as increased human-robot collaboration, ethical considerations in deployment, and the rise of scalable cloud-based solutions. The research underscores the significant value of embodied intelligence in creating dynamic, adaptive, and inclusive educational environments, offering stakeholders a framework for understanding and leveraging these technologies in diverse learning settings.</p>
